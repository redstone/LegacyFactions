# LegacyFactions
A maintained and high performance version of Factions 1.6.

❗️ **Looking for help? [Read the wiki first!](https://github.com/redstone/LegacyFactions/wiki)** ❗️

Keeping the same Factions 1.6 experience with some performance enhancements and improved features - which are of course, all optional!

There has been a **huge** overhaul on the internals of this plugin. Lots of code has been added, removed, and optimised. 

_It's free for everyone!_ But many people have requested to make a donation, you don't have to! But if you want to make a donation [you are more than welcome to](https://www.paypal.me/markhughes/10usd) - thanks! But most of all, **enjoy**!

## New Features and Changes
* /f ahome is now /f home <name> <player/faction>: similar to how the current /f sethome works. The permission to use this is factions.home.any.
* Configuration tidy up, all your orignal settings will stick.
* New help menu with new JSON button support (can be disabled)
* Faction warps have passwords (can be disabled with permission)
* Much better API
* Loads more! [check out the wiki ](https://github.com/redstone/LegacyFactions/wiki)

## Installation
1. Download the latest release.
2. Put LegacyFactions.jar in the plugins folder.
3. Start your server up.

A default config (`config.json`) file will be created on the first run. The default configuration usually works well - but tweak as needed!
